            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Our Data Management Policy establishes a framework for
                identifying, classifying, and managing data assets within our
                organization. This policy provides procedures for documenting
                the types and locations of our data and defines ownership and
                accountability. By implementing effective data management
                practices, we aim to enhance governance, protect sensitive
                information, and ensure compliance with the Personal Data
                Protection Act (PDPA) and other applicable data protection
                regulations.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Scope</h3>
            <p>
                This policy applies to all organization volunteers, employees,
                contractors, and stakeholders. It encompasses the systematic
                identification, classification, and management of all data
                assets. It includes sensitive, personal, confidential, and
                regulated data. Procedures are defined for maintaining an
                accurate, up-to-date data inventory including retention periods,
                sharing agreements, and disposal practices. Compliance is
                mandatory, and exceptions require President approval.
            </p>
