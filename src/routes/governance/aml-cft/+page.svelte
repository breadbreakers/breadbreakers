            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Policy Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Bread Breakers (SG) is committed to preventing our organization from being 
                used as a vehicle for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. 
                This policy is developed in accordance with Singapore's legal and regulatory 
                requirements and follows guidance from the Commissioner of Charities' 
                publication <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.charities.gov.sg/PublishingImages/Resource-and-Training/Guides-Templates-Awards/Guides/Documents/Protecting%20your%20Charity%20against%20Money%20Laundering%20and%20Terrorist%20Financing%20-May%202015.pdf">Protecting Your Charity Against Money Laundering and Terrorist 
                Financing</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Scope and Application</h3>
            <p>
                This policy applies to all donations received by Bread Breakers (SG), 
                all committee members and volunteers acting on our behalf. 
                It covers all donation channels, procurement activities, and fund disbursements.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                We have assessed our risk exposure considering:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Geographic Risk</strong> Operating primarily within Singapore 
                    with established regulatory oversight reduces geographic risk exposure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Service Risk</strong> Direct aid provision to verified beneficiaries 
                    through registered social workers minimizes service-related risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Beneficiary Risk</strong> Working exclusively with qualified social 
                    workers from registered agencies provides additional verification layers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Donor Risk</strong> Online donation platform allows for transaction 
                    monitoring and record-keeping but requires vigilance for unusual patterns.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <strong>Pattern Recognition</strong> We review donation patterns for unusual
