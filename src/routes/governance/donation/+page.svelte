            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">How the Donation Process Works</h3>
            
            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-semibold">Secure Online Donation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Payment Processing</strong> All online donations are processed exclusively through <a href="https://stripe.com/en-sg" class="link" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, a PCI DSS compliant payment gateway that ensures industry-standard security for all transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Accepted Methods</strong> We accept PayNow, major credit and debit cards via Stripe. To ensure traceability and comply with AML/CFT guidelines, we do not accept anonymous cash donations, cryptocurrency, or unverified third-party transfers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transaction Confirmation</strong> Donors receive an immediate email confirmation from our platform with our official acknowledgment and receipt.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-semibold">Fund Allocation & Transparency</h4>
             <p>
                To ensure clarity, all donations are allocated to one of two funds. Donors are required to specify their preference.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Beneficiary Fund</strong> Used exclusively to support our beneficiaries through direct aid, supplies, and services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Operating Fund</strong> Supports essential administrative expenses required to run our programmes. All operating costs are publicly documented.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Live Updates</strong> Our website provides real time updates on the total funds collected.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-semibold">Due Diligence & Aid Disbursement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Beneficiary Verification</strong> We conduct due diligence by verifying all beneficiary needs through social workers. This ensures aid is directed to legitimate cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Internal Approval</strong> Every aid request requires documented approval from the society's President before any funds are disbursed, ensuring proper oversight.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Direct, Traceable Delivery</strong> All aid is procured from approved retailers and delivered directly to addresses provided by the respective social worker. We retain proof of delivery for every transaction, which is available in our public financial ledger.
                </li>
            </ul>
