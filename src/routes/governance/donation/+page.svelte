            <p>
                Bread Breakers Singapore is a volunteer-led, non-profit
                organisation dedicated to supporting individuals and communities
                in need. We rely on donations to sustain our mission and serve

                Our Two Funds
            </h3>
            <p>
                To ensure transparency and clarity, all donations are allocated
                to one of the following two funds:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Beneficiary Fund:</strong> This fund is used exclusively
                    to support individuals or communities we serve. It covers aid,
                    supplies, services, and direct outreach efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Operating Fund:</strong> This fund supports the internal
                    functioning of Bread Breakers Singapore. It helps cover administrative
                    expenses, technology, communication, transportation, volunteer
                    support, and other general upkeep required to run our programmes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Donors may indicate a preferred fund when making a donation.
