            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Our whistleblowing process offers a safe platform for individuals to report any misconduct involving committee members or volunteers, without fear of retaliation.
            </p>
            <p>
                All reports will be independently reviewed and investigated by the President.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whistleblowers are expected to report in good faith. All identities and shared concerns will remain confidential, unless disclosure is legally required to parties such as legal counsel, law enforcement, or investigators.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reportable misconduct may include, but is not limited to, the following:
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Corruption & Bribery</h3>
            <p>
                This includes receiving, soliciting, offering, promising, or giving any form of gratification to influence actions dishonestly. Forms of gratification may include money, property, services, sexual favours, or promises. Favouritism might involve access to confidential information, leniency, special privileges, or contracts.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Fraud</h3>

                Fraud refers to any illegal act involving deception, concealment, or abuse of trust, typically for financial or personal gain. Common examples include asset misappropriation, forgery, or misuse of confidential information.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">Unlawful Conduct</h3>
