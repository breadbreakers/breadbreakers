                While Bread Breakers (SG) implements robust security measures and transparency 
                protocols, donors should be aware of potential risks associated with online donations 
                and charitable giving. Please read this disclosure carefully before making any contribution.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phishing and Fraudulent Sites</strong> Always verify you are on the correct 
                    domain before making donations. Fraudulent sites may impersonate legitimate charities.

                <li>
                    <strong>Data Breaches</strong> While we implement industry-standard security measures, 
                    no online platform can guarantee absolute protection against all cyber threats.

                <li>
                    <strong>Technical Failures</strong> System outages, server failures, or technical

                </li>
                <li>

                    <strong>Volunteer Dependency</strong> As a volunteer-led organization, service 
                    delivery may be affected by volunteer availability or capacity constraints.

                    <strong>Cessation of Operations</strong> In the unlikely event that Bread Breakers (SG) 
                    ceases operations, remaining funds will be distributed in accordance with our 
                    constitution and applicable laws.

                    <strong>Verification Limitations</strong> While we work with qualified social workers

                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Integrations</strong> Our use of third-party services (payment 
                    processors, hosting providers) may expose data to additional risks beyond our direct control.
