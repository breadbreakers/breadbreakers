                We believe that everyone has a role to play in this work of
                practical compassion, whether through giving or serving.

                Fund the Mission
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you're in a season where you can give financially, <a
                    href="/donate">we invite you to sow into our mission</a
                >. Your donation goes directly into meeting specific, verified
                needs, real people, real items, real impact.
            </p>

                Deliver the Mission
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you don't have financial means but have time, energy, or
                skills, <a href="/contact">come join us as an active delivery or procurement
                partner</a>. Weâ€™ll provide the funds. You help us turn compassion
                into action.

                Accountability Matters

            <p>
                Because we are stewarding public donations with transparency and
                care, all partners will go
                through a simple screening and onboarding process. This ensures
                every action taken under the Bread Breakers name maintains the
                integrity and trust we've committed to our supporters.
