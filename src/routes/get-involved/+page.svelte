            <p>Partners may support in one of two ways:</p>

                    <strong>Procurement & Delivery:</strong> Take charge of fulfilling
                    item requests by purchasing and delivering them to beneficiaries
                    on our behalf.

                    recurring needs (e.g. groceries) over a defined period of time.
                    This arrangement is coordinated in agreement with a supporting
                    social worker to ensure appropriateness and alignment.

                Due to our lean, volunteer-led model, individuals serving on the
                Working Group may also directly serve as Partners involved to
                aid procurement and delivery. To maintain strict integrity and
                transparency, a Working Group member acting as a Partner cannot
                approve their own requests, and must be approved by another
                designated member from the Working Group.

                Not all help needs to be physical or financial. If you have a
                heart to encourage, you can serve as someone who sends messages
                of hope, encouragement, and dignity after a delivery is made.
            </p>
            <p>
                These simple acts of kindness remind our beneficiaries that they
                are not alone, and they are deeply valued and loved by God.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Because we are stewarding public donations with transparency and
                care, all partners go through a simple screening and onboarding
                process. This helps ensure that every action taken under the
                Bread Breakers name upholds the trust and integrity we are
                committed to.
