                    Tax Exemptions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Donations made to us are currently not tax-deductible. This
                    is because we are not an Institution of a Public Character
                    (IPC). Achieving IPC status requires a significant track
                    record of good governance and charitable work, which we will
                    diligently build towards. Your generosity, even without tax
                    exemption, makes an immediate and tangible difference.

                    Our Funds
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We operate with two distinct funds to ensure clarity and
                    accountability. The Beneficiary Fund is used solely to
                    procure and deliver essential items directly to individuals
                    and families in need. Every dollar goes toward verified,
                    tangible needs. The Operating Fund supports the
                    behind-the-scenes infrastructure that makes our work
                    possible, covering necessary expenses such as logistics,
                    technology, and basic administrative support. This
                    separation ensures that donations are used purposefully and
                    transparently, whether for direct aid or sustaining the
                    means to deliver it.
