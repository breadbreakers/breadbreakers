                            Low-income individuals and families face a myriad of
                            challenges:

                                <strong>Housing Conditions</strong> Many live in
                                small HDB rental flats, which are typically 1-room
                                (around 35 sq m) or 2-room (around 45 sq m). These
                                flats often suffer from high density, leading to
                                issues with dirty common areas, pervasive smells,
                                trash, and bed bugs that spread easily. The limited
                                interior space often means living rooms double as
                                sleeping areas, and there's little privacy for growing
                                children, especially teenagers.

                                <strong>Housing Insecurity</strong> Despite the HDB's
                                intention not to evict, residents often feel a deep
                                sense of insecurity due to past experiences of homelessness
                                or constant renewals of tenancy and arrears letters,
                                leading to worries about their children becoming
                                homeless if something happens to them.

                                <strong>Economic Strain and Consumerism</strong>
                                Families often run out of money for food and make
                                choices to eat fewer meals so their children can
                                eat more. Living in a highly consumerist society,
                                surrounded by malls and branded goods, creates constant
                                reminders of their inability to meet their children's
                                desires, leading to frustration and guilt.

                                <strong>Low-Wage Work Challenges</strong> Many work
                                in the service sector (cleaners, cashiers, delivery
                                personnel) where they may be ignored, invisible,
                                or treated with disrespect. Their jobs often involve
                                irregular and unpredictable shifts, making it difficult
                                to plan for childcare or family needs, and they have
                                little to no bargaining power or leave benefits.
                                Fear and anxiety about asking for time off are common.

                                <strong>Childcare and Education Gaps</strong> Parents
                                struggle to secure stable employment due to childcare
                                challenges. While government-linked childcare is
                                accessible, conditions for full subsidies can be
                                circular (requiring employment), and location issues
                                or care gaps during sickness or holidays persist.
                                Many parents struggle to help children with schoolwork,
                                leading to children falling behind in school and
                                being identified as "weak." This early tracking can
                                lead to low self-esteem and resistance to school.

                                <strong>Dignity and Stigma</strong> Low-income persons
                                frequently experience micro instances of rudeness
                                and disrespect in daily life. Seeking public assistance
                                is often stigmatizing, involving intrusive personal
                                questions, repeated reviews, and a feeling of being
                                distrusted or interrogated. This process can be dignity-harming
                                and belittling, making people reluctant to seek the
                                help they need.

                                <strong>Lack of Youth Protection</strong> Older children
                                often spend long hours away from home due to limited
                                private space and find it more pleasant to be out
                                with friends. Low-income parents have limited influence
                                over their kids, as their financial dependence is
                                lower due to part-time work, leading to concerns
                                about kids getting into trouble. Youth in these families
                                bear higher levels of risk and are more vulnerable
                                during familial crises.

                                procurement records, and delivery reports, are fully

                            Our work is not only about providing goods; it is
                            fundamentally about offering care, dignity, and
                            hope. Each item delivered serves as a tangible
                            reminder that the recipient is seen, valued, and
                            supported. We believe that providing specific items
                            that children want, such as yellow and white soccer
                            boots, is crucial because what we often think of as
                            "wants" are, in certain contexts, actually "dignity
                            needs" that enable belonging and respect within

                            Low-income individuals frequently face micro
                            instances of rudeness and disrespect in their daily
                            lives. The current systems of social support can
                            sometimes be dignity-harming due to intrusive
                            questioning and repeated scrutiny. Bread Breakers
                            aims to counteract this by providing support in a
                            way that affirms the recipient's inherent worth,
                            without the stigma often attached to seeking aid. We
                            recognize that true dignity stems from the belief in
                            the inherent worth and integrity of other human
                            beings, not from conditional economic productivity

                            or "bad choices." While common prejudices suggest
                            low-income persons have different "values" or avoid

                            parents have limited options for managing their need
                            for money and their children's need for care,
                            largely due to poor employment conditions and a lack
                            of continuous, unconditional public support.

                            The idea that poverty is an individual "mindset"
                            problem is a powerful distraction from looking at
                            poverty as linked to inequality. People in positions
                            of authority often hold the mindset that low-income
                            persons' problems are due to not having the "right
                            mindsets," despite the fact that power is a material
                            condition, not a frame of mind. Changing how
                            low-income individuals think about themselves will
                            not change their lack of control over time, leverage
                            in the labor market, or bargaining power with
                            various authorities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, poverty is deeply linked to structural
                            conditions of inequality. To study poverty without
                            acknowledging inequality can lead to misrecognizing
                            structural issues as individual failings.

                            Bread Breakers Singapore exists to be a trustworthy,

                            To address the persistence of poverty and
                            inequality, it is crucial to disrupt the narrative
                            that views poverty as an individual problem and
                            acknowledge that everyone is implicated and
                            entangled in the existing social matrix. We must
                            move beyond viewing "the poor" as an "other" group
                            to "help" and instead understand that wealth and
                            elitism are two sides of the same coin as poverty
                            and marginality. By expanding our narratives and
                            confronting uncomfortable truths about our society,
                            we can begin to talk about meaningful solutions and
                            foster a more empathetic community.

                            While it might seem counterintuitive to provide what
                            appears to be a "luxury" item, everyone has a right
                            to choice and preferences, even in challenging
                            circumstances. There are often nuances we aren't
                            aware of. For example, a baby might experience hives
                            or rashes from certain diaper brands, necessitating
                            a specific, seemingly more expensive alternative.
                            Similarly, allergies to particular milk powders
                            could mean a child requires a specialized,
                            higher-cost formula. We trust that beneficiaries are
                            requesting items based on genuine needs and personal
                            preferences, and our role is to provide support, not
                            to question their specific requirements.
