                Our Vision
            </h3>
            <p>
                To see faith transformed into compassionate action, such that no
                one lacks essential material support.

                Our Mission
            </h3>
            <p>
                To transparently procure and deliver essential items to
                vulnerable individuals and families, in partnership with social
                service professionals, offering not just goods, but care,
                dignity, and hope.

                The Landscape of Need and the Ecosystem Challenge
            </h3>
            <p>
                While Singapore is a nation of remarkable progress and
                generosity, the reality of need persists. Many unseen
                individuals and families struggle daily to afford basic
                necessities such as food, diapers, milk powder, or essential appliances
                like a functioning refrigerator or washing machine. These are
                fundamental to dignity and well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Needs are often urgent, specific, and deeply personal. Yet
                connecting them to the right resources is frequently hindered by
                logistical and administrative complexity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6 mt-5 has-text-weight-bold">
                Our Faith-Driven Mandate
            </h3>
            <p>
                This initiative is a response to God's call to remember and
                serve the needy, grounded in the teachings of Jesus Christ, who
                championed the poor and marginalized. We believe that serving
                "the least of these brothers and sisters" is a sacred act
                (Matthew 25:40).
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to provide a clear, trustworthy channel for individuals
                and communities to translate faith into action. We bridge the
                gap between good intentions and real impact. Serving as hands and
                feet that deliver practical help where it is most needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our work is not only about providing goods. It is about
                offering care, dignity, and hope. Each item delivered is a
                tangible reminder that the recipient is seen, valued, and
                supported.
            </p>

                The Meaning Behind Our Name

                Sharing and Provision
            </h4>
            <p>
                ‚ÄúBreaking bread‚Äù is a universal symbol of sharing. It reflects
                our mission to provide essentials, from food to household
                items, to those in need. It‚Äôs about ensuring no one is left
                without their daily bread.

            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 has-text-weight-normal is-italic">
                The Bread of Life
            </h4>
            <p>
                For Christians, Jesus is the Bread of Life (John 6:35),
                representing sustenance, love, and eternal life. Our work
                reflects this deeper provision, sharing not only material goods,
                but also the love that Christ embodied.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 has-text-weight-normal is-italic">
                Communion and Fellowship
            </h4>
            <p>
                "Breaking bread" originates from the Christian practice of
                communion, a symbol of unity and equality at the table. Our hope
                is that, one day, those we serve might sit at the same table in
                community and fellowship, regardless of background or
                circumstance.

                Our Guiding Principles
            </h3>

            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 has-text-weight-normal is-italic">
                Faith-Driven
            </h4>
            <p>
                Everything we do is rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ, who
                exemplified love in action. Serving the poor and marginalized is
                not just charity, it is a spiritual calling to live out our faith
                through practical compassion. This principle shapes our work,
                drives our mission, and centers the dignity of every individual
                we serve.
            </p>

                Radical Transparency
            </h4>
            <p>
                We believe trust is built through openness. Our finances and
                operations are shared in full, including monthly bank and debit
                statements, procurement records, and delivery reports. This
                open-book approach builds confidence in how donations are used
                and underscores our commitment to integrity.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 has-text-weight-normal is-italic">
                Robust Governance
            </h4>
            <p>
                We combine compassion with sound governance. Our volunteer led
                structure operates with clear roles, policies, and automated oversight
                mechanisms to ensure ethical and effective operations. We
                believe that love and accountability must go hand in hand.

                Direct Impact
            </h4>
            <p>
                Every contribution goes toward verified, urgent needs, quickly
                and with minimal overhead. By focusing on direct provision and
                leveraging existing relationships with social workers, we
                maximise the practical impact of each donation on the ground.

                Support for Frontline Workers

            <p>
                By providing a reliable and efficient channel for procuring
                specific items, we directly support the invaluable work of
                social workers, freeing up their time to focus on casework and
                relationship building with their clients.

                We create space for families‚Äîespecially those with young
                children‚Äîto connect meaningfully with the diverse realities in
                our society. Through acts of giving, they gain a deeper
