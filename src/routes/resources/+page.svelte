                    <p>
                        What is poverty? What is inequality? How are they
                        connected? How are they reproduced? How might they be
                        overcome? Why should we try?

                        The way we frame our questions shapes the way we see
                        solutions. This book does what appears to be a
                        no-brainer task, but one that is missing and important:
                        it asks readers to pose questions in different ways, to
                        shift the vantage point from which they view ‚Äòcommon
                        sense,‚Äô and in so doing, to see themselves as part of
                        problems and potential solutions. This is a book about
                        how seeing poverty entails confronting inequality. It is
                        about how acknowledging poverty and inequality leads to
                        uncomfortable revelations about our society and
                        ourselves. And it is about how once we see, we cannot,
                        must not, unsee.

                    <p><strong>The Hole in our Gospel</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Is our faith only about going to church, studying the Bible, and avoiding the most serious sins? Or does God expect more? Have we embraced the whole gospel or a gospel with a hole in it?
More than twenty years ago, Rich Stearns came face-to-face with that question as he sat in a mud hut in Rakai, Uganda, listening to the heartbreaking story of an orphaned child. Stearns‚Äôs journey took much more than a long flight to Africa. It took answering God‚Äôs call on his life, a call that tore him out of his corner office at one of America‚Äôs most prestigious corporations, to walk with the poorest of the poor in our world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stearns‚Äôs compelling story demonstrates that the whole gospel was always meant to be a world-changing social revolution, a revolution that begins with each one of us.
